# Tourism-Management-System

Developing a Tourism Management System mobile application involves several stages in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Here's a simplified overview:

## Planning:

• Define project goals, scope, and objectives.
• Identify stakeholders and gather requirements for the mobile app.

## Feasibility Study:

• Assess technical, operational, and economic feasibility of the project.

## System Design:

• Create a high-level design specifying app architecture and functionalities.
• Develop a detailed design, including database schema and user interface.

## Implementation (Coding):

• Write code based on the design specifications.
• Use relevant mobile development frameworks and languages (e.g., Kotlin or Swift for native apps, or frameworks like   React Native or Flutter for cross-platform development).

## Testing:

• Perform unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.
• Identify and fix bugs, ensuring the app functions as intended.

## Deployment:

• Release the mobile app to app stores (e.g., Google Play Store, Apple App Store).
• Ensure compatibility with various devices and screen sizes.

## Maintenance and Support:

• Address post-launch issues and provide updates as needed.
• Monitor user feedback for continuous improvement.

## Documentation:

• Create comprehensive documentation for developers and end-users.

Throughout these stages, communication with stakeholders and continuous testing are crucial for a successful Tourism Management System mobile application.
